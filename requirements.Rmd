All the demonstrations and exercises will be conducted within **R**, the package **scan,** and **RStudio**. So please make sure you bring a computer with those three programs running. Unfortunately, the workshop is too short in time for a mutual installation session.

But there is help:

\
Chapter 3.1 of the book [Analyzing single-case data with R and scan](https://jazznbass.github.io/scan-Book/the-scan-package.html#installing-the-scan-package) explains how to install scan.

If you need further help on R and RStudio, read the Chapters 1 and 2 of the book [Analyzing single-case data with R and scan](https://jazznbass.github.io/scan-Book/).
