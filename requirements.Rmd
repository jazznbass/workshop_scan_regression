All the demonstrations and exercises will be conducted within **R**, the package **scan,** and **RStudio**. So please make sure you bring a computer with those three programs running.

To take full advantage of the course, open RStudio and start the `scan` library so can can switch between your Zoom app and RStudio if needed.

We will be working with the current CRAN version of scan (0.51). Don't forget to update.

(`install.packages("scan"`)

Unfortunately, the workshop is too short in time for a mutual installation session.

But there is help:

\
Chapter 3.1 of the book [Analyzing single-case data with R and scan](https://jazznbass.github.io/scan-Book/the-scan-package.html#installing-the-scan-package) explains how to install scan.

If you need further help on R and RStudio, read the Chapters 1 and 2 of the book [Analyzing single-case data with R and scan](https://jazznbass.github.io/scan-Book/).
